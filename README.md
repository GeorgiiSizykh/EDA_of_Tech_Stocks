# Exploratory Data Analysis of Technology Stocks and S&P 500 (2014-2024)

## Project Aim 

This project conducts a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) of historical closing price data for selected technology stocks (Apple - AAPL, Microsoft - MSFT, Alphabet - GOOGL) and the S&P 500 market index (^GSPC) spanning the period from January 2014 to December 2024. The analysis aims to identify, characterize, and draw preliminary conclusions regarding:

*   **Individual Asset Dynamics:** Statistical properties, price trends, return distributions, and volatility characteristics (including clustering).
*   **Cross-Asset Relationships:** Interdependencies, correlations, market beta relative to the S&P 500, and a comparative assessment of risk-return profiles.
*   **Behavior during Market Stress:** Performance, volatility, maximum drawdowns, and correlation shifts during the H1 2020 COVID-19 pandemic.

## Key Technologies & Libraries

*   **Python 3.x**
*   **Jupyter Notebook/Lab**
*   **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
*   **NumPy:** For numerical operations.
*   **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For data visualization.
*   **yfinance:** For downloading financial data from Yahoo Finance.
*   **SciPy (stats):** For statistical calculations (e.g., linear regression for Beta).
*   **Statsmodels:** For time series analysis tools (e.g., ACF plots).

## Project Structure

*   `Financial_Data_Analysis/data_exploration.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook containing all the analysis, code, and visualizations.
*   `Financial_Data_Analysis/financial_data.csv`: The CSV file where downloaded financial data is stored (generated by the notebook if not present).
*   `Financial_Data_Analysis/.gitignore`: Specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore.
*   `README.md`: This file.

## How to Run

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd <repository-name>/Financial_Data_Analysis 
    ```
2.  **Ensure you have Python and the necessary libraries installed.** You can typically install them using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn yfinance scipy statsmodels jupyterlab
    ```
3.  **Launch Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab:**
    ```bash
    jupyter lab
    ```
    or
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
4.  Open the `data_exploration.ipynb` notebook.
5.  Uncomment the second cell in "Data preparation" section to first download data and save it to `financial_data.csv`. This step is unnecessary if you have downloaded "financial_data.csv" file from the repository.
6.  Run the cells sequentially.

## Data Source

Historical stock price and index data (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) were downloaded from **Yahoo Finance** using the `yfinance` Python library.

## Key Findings (Summary)

*   All analyzed technology stocks (AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL) outperformed the S&P 500 index in terms of annualized returns over the 2014-2024 period, albeit with higher associated volatility.
*   The assets exhibited significant leptokurtic ("heavy-tailed") return distributions and volatility clustering, common characteristics of financial time series.
*   All three technology stocks displayed positive beta coefficients greater than 1, indicating higher systematic risk and amplified movements relative to the S&P 500, but also generated positive alpha, suggesting risk-adjusted outperformance.
*   The H1 2020 COVID-19 market stress period led to a sharp increase in volatility, significant drawdowns, and a notable surge in correlations across all assets.
